<h1>Mobile web is CPU bound</h1>
<p class="intro">Parsing of javascript is a CPU bound operation and the CPUs in many mobile devices are not fast. Therefore, you should limit the amount of javascript being used on pages capable of being viewed on mobile browsers.</p>
<p>Historically, the limiting factor has been the network. However, today the limiting factor more and more tends to be the CPU, since we increasingly use mobile devices when browsing the web. Many websites also rely on a lot of JavaScript being executed before they can show any meaningful content.</p>
