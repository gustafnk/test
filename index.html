    <h1>Microservice Web UIs</h1>
    <p>There are many options when developing and integrating microservice web UIs. In this web site, I want to show that server-side rendered web UIs integrated with transclusion are techniques that allow for high evolvability, compared to client-side rendering. Client-Side Includes are more lightweight and allow for a faster initial release, while keeping the option open for using Edge-Side Includes later, when beneficial. Also, we'll argue that <a href="https://github.com/gustafnk/h-include">h-include</a> is a good choice for a client-side include library.</p>
